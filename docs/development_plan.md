# Development Plan

## Vision
This project aims to be a typing practice application for learning Linux commands.

## Requirements
- Present Linux commands and their descriptions.
- Provide typing exercises that help users memorize command usage.
- Progressively add more commands and difficulty levels.

## Initial Tasks
1. Load a list of basic Linux commands from assets.
2. Display commands to the user for typing practice.
3. Track typing accuracy and speed.
4. Expand command library and categorize by difficulty.

## TDD Guidelines
- Write tests before implementing features.
- When a test fails, fix the implementation rather than altering the test.
- Keep tests small and focused.

## Next Steps
- Implement UI to show commands and capture user input.
- Add scoring logic and result screens.
- Collect feedback to refine command list and difficulty settings.
